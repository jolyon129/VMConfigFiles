# Environment Configuration Files

I put all kinds of linux config boilerplates here.

Including vim config, zsh config, etc.

# Usage

Download into home and create soft links.

For some reason, you'd better create them from the home directory. 

E.g, `ln -sf ~/important-dot-files/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`
