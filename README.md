# Ubuntu VM Environment Configuration

I put all kinds of my general config files here.
Try not repeat myself.

In general, I put common configuration in `.zshrc` and the dedicated config are written in their own `.bashrc` files

# Usage
run `create_soft_links.sh` to make softlinks for these configuration files
